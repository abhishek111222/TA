All the codes tried are here.

hmm.py and mode2.py are the submitted codes for the Task 1.
relations.py is the code for the last Semantic Relations.

The rest are the once that I tried and didn't get satisfactory results. 


Filed HMM is the one with bad results nit workable. 
LSTM_glove didn't give better results than the normal word embedding hence not included in the report (workable)
